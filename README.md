#  Creating a new Dashboard

This is being run on one of my home servers that will one day grow up and turn into Jarvis.

Right now, I'm just using the OpenWeatherMap API to build up a time/weather/forecast dashboard.

However, I've got a few ESP32 boards that need to be put into service to report temperatures, humidities, ait-speed, nearby aircraft (not even joking).

Right now though, I'm just warming up!
